This script will output (to the file `pre_restaints.dat`) as set of list of
interactions corresponding to strong PREs that should correspond to distances
<1.9 nm.

The residues are consecutively numbered starting from one, with the 4 Calcium
residues coming after the protein, followed by the peptide.


The script will also output a file that can be loaded into VMD
(`close_residues.tcl`) in order to visualize the restraints.
