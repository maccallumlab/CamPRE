# extract_pre_distances

This script analyzes the PRE data using a two-point
relaxation method to estimate the distance between 
the spin label and backbone protons. Zhihong has
already computed gamma in the excel file, so we
just need to compute the distance.

It also computes the same distance based on the
with_OND.pdb file, which has simulated spin label
positions.
